I'm Anton.

I'm a software engineer specializing in full stack and blockchain development. I am a huge open source fanatic and love to get involved in the very projects and tools I use every day. 

I'm always down for a chat about tech. Feel free to add me on [LinknedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonre/).
