### Hey 👋

My name is Anton. I mostly work with backend frameworks such as Spring, Next and Express. However I'm always learning new things!

A random fact about me is I absolutely **LOVE** mango juice 🥭 and sushi 🍣.

Working on a server management [platform](http://controlserverhosting.com/)

The best way to contact me would be by adding me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonre/).

Take a look at some of my pinned projects down below!
