Hi👋 my name is Anton. I'm a software engineer based out of Toronto, Canada.

Past Experience in
- Blockchain / Web3
- Fintech
- Educational Tech
- Telecom 



🩹 In the past I interned at a medical tech company where I helped fix inconsistencies in how data is handled in the Canadian healthcare system.

📈 After that, I worked on a staking startup. The goal was to allow anyone regardless of technical skill to stake their current crypto assets.

🔧 Currently working on community building tools for another Web3 startup.

📖 Also helping build the platform and tools used to run the annual Concordia University hackathon.

🤝 I'm constantly getting involved in open source projects, as I love to work on the very tools and projects that I use on a daily basis.
