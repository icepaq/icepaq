Hi👋 my name is Anton. I'm a software engineer based out of Toronto, Canada.

__In the Past__

🩹 I interned at one of Canada's top [EMRs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/what-is-an-emr/)

📈 Built a crypto staking startup

🌐 Spent the summer with Ante Labs, writing smart contracts

🎨 Worked at [Montra](http://montra.com/) building video processing pipelines for an online video editor

📊 Built an AI-powered automated bookkeeping platform. This was my first real startup. After four months I decided to close the doors to focus on companies that better aligned with my experience.
