__In the Past__

🩹 I interned at one of Canada's top [EMR](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/what-is-an-emr/) companies where I fixed inconsistencies in how data is handled in the Canadian healthcare system.

📈 After that, I worked on a staking startup. The goal was to allow anyone regardless of technical skill to stake their crypto assets.

🌐 I worked at a Web3 company as a software engineer building a layer of trust for DAOs and other blockchain protocols.

🎨 Most recently, I worked at [Montra](http://montra.com/) building creative video tools for education and corporate. My focus was on architecture and the video processing pipeline.


__Currently__

🤝 Constantly getting involved in open-source projects. I love to work on the very tools and projects that I use on a daily basis. I help maintain [Drift](https://drift.lol/), VSCode, and many more!

📊 Building [Monitico](https://www.moniti.co/), an accounting automation platform that allows you to easily capture invoices and receipts as well as ask your your accountant chatbot questions and get it to generate reports.
