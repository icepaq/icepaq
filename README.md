### Hey 👋

My name is Anton. I'm a fullstack developer working with Spring Boot and Node.

A random fact about me is I absolutely **LOVE** mango juice 🥭 and sushi 🍣.

Working on a server management [platform](http://controlserverhosting.com/).

The best way to contact me would be by adding me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonre/).
