### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton. I mostly work with backend frameworks such as Spring and Express. Although I love to try new things out. I'll sometimes work with some front-end projects, the VSCode API or even my Arduino!

A random fact about me is I absolutely **LOVE** mango juice and sushi.

The best way to contact me would be by adding me on (https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonre/) [LinkedIn].

Take a look at some of my pinned projects down below!
